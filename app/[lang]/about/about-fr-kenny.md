# About Fr. Kenny

Fr. Kenny Ang, a native of Jakarta, found his calling to the priesthood as a profound gift, a journey that unfolded gradually, guided by the enduring verities and inherent grace of the Catholic faith. He was ordained in 2019, joining the clergy of the Diocese of Surabaya. Since then, he's spent a fair bit of time on the circuit, delivering talks and leading sessions for audiences in Indonesia, Singapore, the United States, and Italy.

At bottom, it's the act of teaching that truly quickens his intellectual pulse. It's a relentless spur, he'll tell you, pushing him to keep digging deeper, to refine his thoughts. Without it, he suspects, his own studies wouldn't quite have the same heft. His overarching aim is straightforward enough: to help people untangle the intricacies of belief and find their way closer to God, whom he understands to be the ultimate source of genuine happiness.

When he's off the clock, you might find him tucked away with a book that truly makes him ponder, or perhaps coaxing a tune from a pipe organ. He also has a quiet affinity for capturing moments through the lens of a camera. These days, he hangs his hat in the Eternal City.
