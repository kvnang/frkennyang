# About Fr. Kenny

I was born and raised in Jakarta, and over the years I’ve lived in Indonesia, the United States, Spain, and now Italy. My path to the priesthood took shape gradually, drawn by the truth and beauty of the Catholic faith. I was ordained in 2019 for the Diocese of Surabaya. Since then, I’ve had the chance to give talks and lead sessions in Indonesia, Singapore, the United States, and Italy.

Teaching is what drives me. It pushes me to keep learning and to think more carefully. I doubt I’d study as much—or as seriously—without it. My hope is to help people grow in their understanding of the faith and to come closer to God, who is the source of real joy.

In my free time, I enjoy reading thought-provoking books, playing the pipe organ, and capturing moments through photography. These days, I make my home in the Eternal City.
