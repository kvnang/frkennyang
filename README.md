## Updating Posts

Posts can be found under `src/posts` folder. Each post consists of a folder with a unique name. That folder contains an `index.md` file and all the necessary assets such as images. For translation, create a file named `index.{lang}.md`, for example `index.id.md`. Currently this site only supports ID (Bahasa Indonesia) and EN (English), which is the default.

Basic folder structure:

```
posts
  |-- Post Title 1
    |-- index.md
    |-- index.id.md (optional)
    |-- image123.jpg
  |-- Post Title 2
    |-- index.md
    |-- etc ...
```

## Writing a Post

### Front Matter

In your `index.md` file, you will need to write some data in Front Matter. Front Matter must be written at the very top of the document, sandwiched between two lines of triple hyphens (`---`), like this:

```markdown
---
title: Lorem Ipsum
featuredImage: image.jpg
format: Article
date: 2020-02-01
category:
  - Homily
  - Mass
excerpt: Lorem ipsum
---
```

Currently supported Front Matter data is as follows:

1. `title`: Title of the post / article
2. `featuredImage`: Featured image, referencing file name within the same folder as the `.md` file
3. `format`: Choose `Article` or `Video`
4. `date`: Date when the post is published. Must be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
5. `category`: An array of categories of the post (can be more than one). See above for formatting
6. `excerpt`: Short excerpt of the post. Recommended length is less than 250 characters.

### Images

#### Best Practices

1. **Image dimension.** Image width should be <= 1800px for full-sized images. Images of **landscape** orientation is always preferred than portrait.
2. **Image compression.** Try to upload images that are less than 300 KB. It's recommended to run the image through a compression tool such as [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) first before using them. For optimal compression, for images without transparency, compress them to MozJPEG format. If they have transparency, compress them to OxiPNG format.
3. **Image source.** Ensure that you have the right to use all your images. If you need to use stock images, ensure that they are royalty-free, or else you might need to credit properly. For example, [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) has royalty-free stock images.
4. **Image alternative text.** Ensure that images have proper alternative texts. This is crucial for the site's accessibility and SEO. Alternative text needs to be wrapped by square brackets (`[your alt text here]`) before the image source reference, for example:

```markdown
![Child studying](child.jpg)
```

#### Alignment

For inline images (i.e. images used within the body of your post, _not_ as featured image), you may choose to align the image to right / left (and therefore wrapping some texts on the opposite side). To do so, you need to use the following syntax:

```markdown
![Child studying](child.jpg '#float=left')
```

Adding `'#float=left'` after the image source will align the image to the left. To align it to the right, use `'#float=right'` instead.

Inline images will always be of 45% width of the container on all viewports except on mobile viewports, where 100% width will be maintained.

#### Captions

To caption an image, add the caption as _italics_ below the image, for example:

```markdown
![Child studying](child.jpg)
_Credit: lorem ipsum_
```
