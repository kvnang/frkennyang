## Updating Posts

Posts can be found under `src/posts` folder. Each post consists of a folder with a unique name. That folder contains an `index.md` file and all the necessary assets such as images. For translation, create a file named `index.{lang}.md`, for example `index.id.md`. Currently this site only supports ID (Bahasa Indonesia) and EN (English), which is the default.

Basic folder structure:

```
posts
  |-- Post Title 1
    |-- index.md
    |-- index.id.md (optional)
    |-- image123.jpg
  |-- Post Title 2
    |-- index.md
    |-- etc ...
```

### Writing a Post

#### Front Matter

In your `index.md` file, you will need to write some data in Front Matter. Front Matter must be written at the very top of the document, sandwiched between two lines of triple hyphens (`---`), like this:

```markdown
---
title: Lorem Ipsum
featuredImage: image.jpg
format: Article
date: 2020-02-01
category:
  - Homily
  - Mass
excerpt: Lorem ipsum
---
```

Currently supported Front Matter data is as follows:

1. `title`: Title of the post / article
2. `featuredImage`: Featured image, referencing file name within the same folder as the `.md` file
3. `format`: Choose `Article` or `Video`
4. `date`: Date when the post is published. Must be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
5. `category`: An array of categories of the post (can be more than one). See above for formatting
6. `excerpt`: Short excerpt of the post. Recommended length is less than 250 characters.
