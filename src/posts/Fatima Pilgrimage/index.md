## Places of Worship

Fatima attracts around 6 million visitors annually. The Shrine of Fatima has three main places of worship.

### *Capelinha*

Built: 1919

The most important of these is the Chapel of the Apparitions—*Capelinha* (Small Chapel) in Portuguese—the first chapel constructed in Fatima. The original statue of Our Lady of Fatima is encased in glass and placed on a stand that covers the holm oak tree where **Mary appeared to the children in 5 of the 6 apparitions**. Mary herself requested a chapel to be built at this location.

### Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary

Built: 1928–1953

The Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary stands at the location where **the three shepherds were playing** on May 13, 1917, the day of Mary's first apparition.

### Basilica of the Holy Trinity

Built: 2007

The newest of the three is the Basilica of the Holy Trinity, designed by Greek architect Alexandros Tombazis. **The first stone used in the construction of this basilica came from a marble fragment of Peter's tomb in Rome.** This Basilica can accommodate over 8,000 pilgrims at a time.

## Customs

### Crawling on the Knees

As an act of penance, some pilgrims crawl on their knees for 182 meters from the **Basilica of the Most Holy Trinity** to the ***Capelinha*** while reciting the Rosary.

### Waving White Handkerchiefs

The tradition of waving white handkerchiefs signifies devotion and love towards the Blessed Virgin Mary. Typically, it is performed at the end of an event, such as a Mass or procession, as a way of saying goodbye to Our Lady.

### Homes of the Shepherds

The homes of Francisco, Jacinta, and Lúcia in the village of Aljustrel are just 3 kilometers from the Sanctuary. The homes have been preserved and all the original furniture remains intact. They give us a unique look into life in rural Portugal during the early 20th century.

### *Via Sacra*

The *Via Sacra* (“Sacred Way”) is the route taken by the three shepherd children from Aljustrel to the Sanctuary. It starts at the **Monument to the Three Little Shepherds** and ends at the **Chapel of Saint Stephen**.

Pilgrims on this path can pray the Way of the Cross along the way and reach the **Monument of Our Lady (Valinhos)**, the site where Our Lady appeared in August 1917, as well as **Loca do Cabeço**, the location of the first and third apparitions of the Angel of Peace.
