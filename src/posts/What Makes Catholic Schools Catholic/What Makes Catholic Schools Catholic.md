An Article in Light of [Gravissimum Educationis](https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651028_gravissimum-educationis_en.html)

People who are acquainted with me know that, until university, I never went to a Catholic school. The reason was quite simple: the Catholic school in my district was not good enough to meet my parents’ expectations.
Indeed, I am still saddened by the fact that many Catholic schools do not live up to their name. There are not only ‘nominal Catholics;’ there are also ‘nominal Catholic schools.’ The following words of a twentieth-century saint drive this point home:

> I must confess that I do not like the expressions ‘Catholic schools,’ ‘Church schools,’ etc., even though I respect those who think differently. I prefer to see things distinguished by their results and not by their names. A school is truly Christian when it strives for excellence, and gives a complete education — which includes Christian ideals — at the same time respecting personal freedom and earnestly furthering social justice. If this is accomplished, then the name is of little importance.

Since children’s education no doubt occupies one of the top positions in parents’ list of priority, it is only reasonable that they would choose what is best for their kids, even if that would mean entrusting them to a non-Catholic school. They wish they could send their children to a Catholic school. But, for various reasons and circumstances, they just responsibly cannot.

Are you a Catholic parent trying to pick a school to enroll your children to? Are you a school administrator, a teacher, a parish priest, or a chaplain involved—in one way or another—in running a Catholic school? Or, are you an ordinary Catholic seeking to better the panorama of Catholic schools in your area? If yes, then this article is for you! Here, I will elaborate on three characteristics that would constitute an authentically Catholic school in light of a timeless Vatican II document dealing with education, Gravissimum Educationis, published on October 28, 1965.

1. Consciousness of Being Part of the Church
   The first trait that sets Catholic schools apart from other schools is each school’s consciousness of being part of the Church. Non-Catholic schools might strive to meet the demands of its ambitious board of directors or succumb to the market trend. A truly Catholic school, however, will never forget that it belongs to the very Church founded by Christ. Its mission is no different than the Church’s. Every Catholic school is a means—the most important one indeed—with which the Church imparts Christian education. “[A]ll Christians … have a right to a Christian education.”
   In addition, a school’s consciousness of being part of the Church would generate the consciousness of being a collaborator of its students’ parents. Every child’s primary educators are not their school teachers, but their own parents. Catholic school teachers ought to “work as partners with parents … in every phase of education.”
   Only when a school is conscious of being part of the Church can it be worthily called Catholic.
2. Harmony of Faith and Reason
   Another characteristic of authentically Catholic schools is harmony of faith and reason. Many schools—non-Catholic and Catholic alike—claim to provide an integral and interdisciplinary education. Yet an education can be truly integral only if it is marked by harmony of faith and reason. An education that excludes Christian faith, therefore, can never be integral. Worse still are those educational institutions that bear the title ‘Catholic’ but provide no or embarrassingly substandard formation in Catholic faith.
   At this point, it is convenient to clarify that harmony of faith and reason does not mean that secular sciences—such as physics, biology, and the like—lose their methodological independence. In other words, biology will not turn into theology; physics will remain as such. The study of these subjects would still be pursued “according to their own principles, method, and liberty of scientific inquiry, in such a way that an ever deeper understanding in these fields may be obtained.”
   The harmony of faith and reason does mean, though, that Christian formation and instruction in secular subjects must go hand in hand. An integral education, indeed, should aim at developing the human person in all his aspects—e.g., intellectual, emotional, cultural, moral, and professional. The academic outcome is never the sole parameter to gauge how Catholic a school is. A Catholic school that tops the ranking of schools based on final exam scores, for example, may not necessarily be authentically Catholic. Why so? Because human being is more than just intellect. Every one of us has a body which, in a certain sense, also ought to be educated. we have senses, which must be put into contact with the beautiful. We have will, which ought to be impregnated by noble intentions. We have emotions, which have to be put in conformity with reason. Our intellect, in turn, should also be enlightened by faith.
   Only when a school provides an integral education marked by harmony of faith and reason can it be worthily called ‘Catholic.’
3. Teaching as a Vocation
   The last feature of a Catholic school is its conviction that the duty of teaching is a vocation. Granted: the idea that teaching is a vocation is not exclusively Catholic. Non-Catholic Christian or even non-Christian teachers may sincerely believe that they have been called by God—or by another being or beings they regard as divine—to teach. Yet an article on Catholic schools would not be complete without a reference to teachers, who are so crucial that “the Catholic school depends upon them almost entirely for the accomplishment of its goals and programs.”[^1]
   Here are three traits of Catholic teachers without which no Catholic school would be worthy of its name.
   Competent. Teachers should “be very carefully prepared so that both in secular and religious knowledge they are equipped with suitable qualifications and also with a pedagogical skill that is in keeping with the findings of the contemporary world.” I would emphasize the word ‘both.’ Teachers who are not fully practicing their Catholic faith are simply out of place in a Catholic school. Why? Because students need to see the harmony between what is being taught in different school subjects. They ought to be led to appreciate that there is no contradiction between what is being taught in sociology and religion since all truths originate from God, the Truth himself.
   Apostolic. Teachers ought to be apostles. This, of course, presupposes their deeply rooted Catholic faith, since they are called to, “by their life as much as by their instruction[,] bear witness to Christ, the unique Teacher.” In other words, a good teacher—notwithstanding the subject she imparts—would bring the Gospel to her classroom! She does so perhaps not explicitly by referring to Christ or the Bible, but by sincerely demonstrating her joy, patience, and love of truth.
   Loving. Teachers should be “[i]ntimately linked in charity to one another and to their students.” Charity consists in wanting what is good for another. A teacher’s love towards her students, though, must not cease on graduation day. The Church rather encourages all teachers, “even after graduation[,] to continue to assist [their students] with advice, friendship and by establishing special associations imbued with the true spirit of the Church.” This enjoinment more clearly affirms that teaching is a vocation; a teacher’s responsibility toward his students does not stop at graduation, but goes beyond it!
   Only when a school boasts a roster of highly competent, zealously apostolic, and earnestly loving teachers can it be worthily called Catholic.

As I was writing this article, I recalled a conversation I had with an acquaintance of mine a couple of years ago. Knowing that he was a fervent Catholic, I was surprised when I found out that he chose not to send his daughters to a Catholic school. “How come, Bob (not his real name)?” I wondered. His answer was astonishingly pithy: “I would rather know that my daughters are being educated by demons—this way, I can set aside time to provide them with adequate Christian formation at home—than believe that they are being educated by angels when, in reality, they are being taught by demons.”

If you are a Catholic parent considering a Catholic school for your children, investigate whether the three above-described qualities are present in the school. That way, you will ensure that the Catholic school you are looking at is truly Catholic. On the other hand, if you are a school administrator, a teacher, a parish priest, or a chaplain involved—in one way or another—in running a Catholic school, I beg of you to question yourself: what can I do to increase consciousness of being part of the Church, the harmony of faith and reason, as well as the quality of teachers in the Catholic school I am responsible for?
