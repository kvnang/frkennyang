## Façade
![Rome Saint John Lateran facade by Alessandro Galilei](jl-facade.jpg '©2022 Kenny Ang')

Date: 1735 | Artist: Alessandro Galilei

Damaged by two fires in the 14th century, it was rebuilt in the late 16th century during the papacy of Sixtus V. The Latin inscription on the façade reads:

> Pope Clement XII, in the fifth year [of his Pontificate, dedicated this building] to Christ the Savior, in honor of Saints John the Baptist and [John] the Evangelist.

The façade is crowned by statues of Christ, St. John the Baptist, St. John the Evangelist, and Doctors of the Eastern and Western Churches. 

## The First Jubilee

The first column on the right-hand side of the interior has a portion of the celebrated fresco by Giotto, which depicts Pope Boniface VIII's announcement of the first [Holy Year](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Year-of-Jubilee) in 1300.

## Statues of the Apostles

Date: 18th century | Artist: Carlo Maratta and others

Francesco Borromini's architecture had twelve empty spaces for a long time. In 1702, Pope Clement XI and Cardinal Benedetto Pamphili announced that they wanted to put twelve sculptures of the Apostles in those niches, with the exception of Judas Iscariot, who was replaced by St. **Paul** (instead of St. Matthias). 

Each statue was to be sponsored by a distinguished prince. The Pope himself sponsored St. **Peter**, while Cardinal Pamphili sponsored St. **John the Evangelist**. Most of the sculptors were given a sketch by [Carlo Maratta](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carlo-Maratta), the Pope's favorite painter, as a guide.

## Papal Altar and Ciborium
![Rome Saint John Lateran Papal Altar used by Peter](jl-altar.jpg 'Papal Altar. ©2020 Kenny Ang')

This Basilica's papal altar is one of the most revered in Rome. Enshrined inside it are the remains of a **wooden table** where the first popes and martyrs—St. **Peter** included—celebrated Mass.

The papal altar is positioned under a triumphal **ciborium**. The two silver **reliquary busts** placed on top of this altar contain **relics** that have touched the **remains of Sts. Peter and Paul**.

The *Confessio*, located in front of the altar, houses the tomb of Pope Martin V, who restored St. John Lateran and ended the [Great Western Schism](https://www.britannica.com/event/Western-Schism) (1378–1417) that had split the Church for 39 years.

## Last Supper Table
![Rome Saint John Lateran Tabernacle and a piece of Last Supper table above it](jl-tabernacle.jpg 'Tabernacle and a piece of Last Supper table above it. ©2022 Kenny Ang')

In Jerusalem, St. Helen—Constantine's mother—found **a piece of the table** Jesus used during the **Last Supper** and brought it here. It is located above the altar where the **Blessed Sacrament** is kept, surrounded by a bronze relief depicting the Last Supper.

## Apse Mosaic

### The First Image of Christ
![Rome Saint John Lateran First Image of Christ](jl-apse-christ.jpg 'First Image of Christ. ©2022 Kenny Ang')

At the center of the apse mosaic is the **first public image of Christ** dating to the 4th century. It served as the model for the later representations of Christ.

Six saints were added to the mosaic in the 6th century. In the 13th century, Jacopo Torriti added the depictions of Pope Nicholas IV, St. Francis, and St. Anthony. Both Nicholas IV and Torriti were **Franciscans**.

### Christ's Divinity
![Rome Saint John Lateran Apse Mosaic by Jacopo Torriti](jl-apse.jpg '©2022 Kenny Ang')

The apse mosaic emphasizes Christ's divine nature and the salvific power of baptism. Positioned from left to right are **Paul**, **Peter**, **Francis of Assisi** (small), **Nicholas IV** (smaller), **Mary**, **John the Baptist**, **Anthony of Padua** (small), **John the Evangelist**, and **Andrew**.

Of these figures, four hold scrolls that proclaim Christ's divinity. Paul’s scroll reads:

> we are expecting a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ (Philippians 3:20).

Peter’s scroll contains his profession of faith:

> You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God (Matthew 16:16).

John’s scroll says:

> In the beginning was the Word (Jn 1:1). 

Andrew's refers to his calling:

> You are my Teacher (see John 1:38–41).

### Baptism: New Creation
![Rome Saint John Lateran Deers, streams of water, and a Phoenix on a Tree of Life](jl-apse-phoenix.jpg 'Deers, streams of water, and a Phoenix on a Tree of Life. ©2022 Kenny Ang')

From the **Cross adorned with precious gems** flow **four streams of water** from which the deers drink. The four streams point back to Eden:

> A river flows out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it divides and becomes four branches (Genesis 2:10). 

This scene recalls our yearning for God:

> As a deer longs for flowing streams, so my soul longs for you, O God (Psalm 42:1).

It also represents Ezekiel's vision:

> Then he brought me back to the entrance of the temple; there, water was flowing from below the threshold of the temple … Wherever the river goes, every living creature that swarms will live, and there will be very many fish, once these waters reach there (Ezekiel 47:1, 9).

Ezekiel's vision narrates the restoration of all creatures—the **new creation**. For this reason, between the streams lies the **Tree of Life**. Perching on this Tree is a **phoenix**, a bird that symbolizes **resurrection** and **regeneration**. Below the Tree, we see the **New Jerusalem**. The river at the bottom is the river **Jordan**, a symbol of **Christian baptism**.

## Lateran Baptistery

- Founder: Constantine I
- Built: 313–318 (with later modifications)
- Name: San Giovanni in Fonte

### The First Baptistery
![Rome Saint John Lateran](jl-baptistery-8.jpg '©2020 Kenny Ang')

Since the first century, baptisms in Rome happened near flowing water. [Tertullian](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tertullian), a lawyer and Christian convert from the 2nd century, tells us that **St. Peter baptized people in the Tiber**.[^1]

The Lateran Baptistery is the **first baptistery** in Rome. Tradition has it that Constantine was baptized here. It has a **circular** structure. For the Romans, circles denote **perfection**. [Hadrian’s Mausoleum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castel_Sant%27Angelo) is also circular, for instance.

Pope [Sixtus III](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Sixtus-III) (432–440) redesigned the baptistery into its current **octagonal** layout. The octagonal shape represents **Christ's resurrection on the eighth day**, which is also known as the "first day of the week" (John 20:19). It also signifies the **new creation**: after the seven days of creation comes the eighth day, representing the new creation: through baptism, we are **reborn** and **created anew**. That is why baptism is also known as **regeneration**.

### Catechesis on Baptism
![Rome Saint John Lateran](jl-baptistery.jpg '©2020 Kenny Ang')

Engraved on the architrave is the **catechesis of Sixtus III** on baptism:

1.  Here is born a people of noble race, destined for Heaven, / whom the Spirit brings forth in the waters he has made fruitful.
    
2.  Mother Church conceives her offspring by the breath of God, / and bears them virginally in this water.
    
3.  Hope for the Kingdom of Heaven, you who are reborn in this font. / Eternal life does not await those who are only born once.
    
4.  This is the spring of life that waters the whole world, / taking its origin from the Wounds of Christ.
    
5.  Sinner, to be purified, go down into the holy water. / It receives the unregenerate and brings him forth a new man.
    
6.  If you wish to be made innocent, be cleansed in this pool, / whether you are weighed down by original sin or your own.
    
7.  There is no barrier between those who are reborn and made one / by the one font, the one Spirit, and the one faith.
    
8.  Let neither the number nor the kind of their sins terrify anyone; / once reborn in this water, they will be holy.

## *Scala Sancta*

The Holy Stairs *(Scala Sancta)* are a set of **28 white marble steps**, originally located in **Jerusalem**, encased in wooden risers. Jesus climbed the marble steps during his Passion on the way to Pontius Pilate's *praetorium*:

> Then they took Jesus from Caiaphas to Pilate’s headquarters *[praetorium]* (John 18:28).

St. [Helena](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Helena), the mother of Constantine I, is credited with bringing the stairs to the Lateran Palace in the 4th century. In 1589, Pope Sixtus V relocated the steps to their current location, in front of the personal chapel of the early Popes called the *Sancta Sanctorum* (Holies of Holies).

The Holy Stairs may only be climbed on the **knees**.
