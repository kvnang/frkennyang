excerpt: Bernadette Soubirous was born in Lourdes, France, in 1844. At 14, she had visions of the Virgin Mary, who instructed her to build a chapel. Bernadette transmitted Mary's messages and entered a local boarding school. In 1866, she entered the novitiate in Nevers and spent the rest of her life in prayer and seclusion. She died willingly accepting her sufferings. Pope Pius XI authenticated her visions and canonized her. Bernadette's birthplace (Boly Mill), the Sacred Heart Parish, the Dungeon, the Hospice, the Old Presbytery, and the Lacadé Mill are places to explore on her pilgrimage route.

## Life of Bernadette

Born: Lourdes, 1844 | Died: Nevers, 1879 | Canonized: 1933

Bernadette Soubirous was the eldest of nine children from a poor family. She suffered from frail health. Her father was a miller.

Between February 11 and July 16, 1858, at the age of 14, she had a series of **visions of the Virgin Mary in the nearby Massabielle Grotto**. During the visions, Mary identified herself as "**the Immaculate Conception**," among other messages and affirmations. She instructed Bernadette to **build a chapel** there. Bernadette transmitted Mary's messages faithfully but tried to **escape public attention** by entering a local boarding school run by the Sisters of Charity of Nevers.

In 1866, Bernadette was granted admission into the **novitiate in the motherhouse at Nevers**, where she completed her religious instruction and **spent her remaining years in prayer and seclusion**. Despite constant **sickness and pain**, she was known for her kindliness, holiness, and wit. She died willingly accepting her great sufferings in faithful fulfillment of **Our Lady's request for penance**.

Pope **Pius XI** authenticated her visions and the veneration of Mary as Our Lady of Lourdes. He also canonized Bernadette. The chapel of the St. Gildard convent in Nevers houses her incorrupt body.

To follow in Bernadette's footsteps in Lourdes, we can explore the following places.

### Boly Mill

Boly Mill *(Moulin de Boly)* is the place where **Bernadette was born** on January 7, 1844, and lived with her parents for 10 years. She called it the "water mill of happiness.” You can see the room where she was born, the kitchen, and an old water-mill with grindstones that was fixed up in 2012.

### Sacred Heart Parish

The current parish church, which conserves **Bernadette’s baptismal font**, was constructed between 1875 and 1903. Father Peyramale's tomb is located in the crypt. This church replaced the old Saint-Pierre church which Bernadette used to attend before it was destroyed by fire in 1904.

### The Dungeon

The Soubirous family faced difficult times, with François (Bernadette's father) losing his job during the winter of 1857. As a result, they had to move to the Dungeon *(Le Cachot)*, which was a cold and dark single room of 16m² that used to be a prison until 1824. The family lived there until the fall of 1858.

On February 11, 1858, Bernadette went to the Massabielle Grotto from the Dungeon to collect dry wood. It was there that she saw Our Lady 18 times.

### The Hospice

The Sisters of Charity of Nevers established the old hospice adjacent to the current Hospital Centre of Lourdes in 1834. When Bernadette returned from Bartrès in 1858 at the age of 13, she was unable to read or write. Therefore, she attended the school for girls from the countryside created by the Sisters of Nevers.

On June 3, 1858, Bernadette received her **first communion** in the hospice's chapel.

### Old Presbytery

On March 2, 1858, Bernadette went to the Presbytery to meet with Father [Dominique Peyramale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominique_Peyramale), the priest of Lourdes. She shared with him the words the Virgin had spoken to her, "**I am the Immaculate Conception**." Today, a plate commemorates this event and part of the wall and door that Bernadette used to enter the garden are still preserved.

### Lacadé Mill

The Lacadé Mill *(Maison Paternelle)* became the **home of Bernadette's parents** after the 1858 apparitions. Inside, you can see the furniture, objects, and pictures that belonged to the Soubirous family. The house is still managed by Bernadette's descendants.
