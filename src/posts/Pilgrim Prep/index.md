Preparing for a pilgrimage requires a holistic approach that encompasses our soul, body, and pack. Taking the time to prepare each aspect is essential to ensure a meaningful journey. By following the practical tips in this article, you will be able to embark on a pilgrimage with a clear and focused mind, a strong and healthy body, and a well-prepared pack.

## Prepare Your Soul

### 1. Improve your prayer routine
- Pray a daily rosary.
- Read the Gospels for 10 minutes each day.
- Spend 15 minutes in silent prayer. Talk to Jesus about your life, the pilgrimage, or the Gospel passage you read.
- Pray daily for our pilgrimage group.
- Ask others to pray for you.

### 2. Keep a prayer journal
- Reflect on Luke 1:39—"Mary arose and went with haste."
- Ask yourself questions such as:  
	- What comes to mind when you read Luke 1:39?  
	- How are you like Mary in this verse?  
	- What does this verse mean to you?  
	- Why did you decide to make this pilgrimage?  

### 3. Collect prayer intentions
- Ask friends and family members, "How can I pray for you during my pilgrimage?" Write down the intentions in your journal.
- Create a social media poll, asking something like, "I'm going on a pilgrimage in August. How can I pray for you while I'm there?"
- Send postcards to people you prayed for during the pilgrimage. You can buy a postcard in Fatima and write something like, "I prayed for you at Fatima!"

### 4. Practice sacrifice
- Offer up any worries or stress you have to God. For example, if packing is difficult, make it a small sacrifice to offer up to God.
- Try fasting to help you think about God and offer up your daily problems to him. This can also prepare you for any hunger or impatience you may feel during your pilgrimage.  
	- Consider stopping eating your favorite food or skipping a meal each week as a form of fasting.

### 5. Learn about the places you will visit

- Set up an out-of-office message for WhatsApp and emails.

## Prepare Your Body

- Practic walking at least 10 km a day, at least 4 months before departure.

- Break them in as early as possible.
