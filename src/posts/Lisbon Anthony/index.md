## Church of St. Anthony

First chapel: 15th century | Current church: 18th century

The Church of St. Anthony (*Igreja de Santo Ant처nio* in Portuguese) is located in the Alfama district, the oldest neighborhood of Lisbon. The site of the family house where St. Anthony was born is located very close to Lisbon Cathedral. In the 15th century, it was turned into a small chapel which was rebuilt in the early 16th century during the reign of King Manuel I. However, the chapel was destroyed by the 1755 earthquake that devastated much of Lisbon. In the aftermath of the earthquake, a decision was made to build a new Baroque-Rococo church on the site under the direction of the architect Mateus Vicente de Oliveira. Construction began in 1767.
