Many liturgical texts are like collages of scriptural verses. In this article, I specifically present the biblical foundation of the Catholic Mass. I am heavily indebted to the page compiled by Felix Just, S.J., which can be found [here](https://catholic-resources.org/Bible/Biblical-Mass-Texts.htm). There is also a helpful article by Karlo Broussard [here](https://www.catholic.com/magazine/print-edition/the-mass-is-profoundly-biblical).

## Introductory Rites

The Introductory Rites constitute a preparation for the Holy Mass. They “ensure that the faithful, who come together as one, establish communion and dispose themselves properly to listen to the Word of God and to celebrate the Eucharist worthily.”[^1]

### Sign of the Cross

#### "In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."

> Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (Mt 28:19).

> Go through the city, through Jerusalem, and put a mark *[taw]* on the foreheads of those who sigh and groan over all the abominations that are committed in it (Eze 9:4).

#### "Amen."

> <sup>5</sup> And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was standing above all the people; and when he opened it, all the people stood up. <sup>6</sup> Then Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God, and all the people answered, “Amen, Amen,” lifting up their hands (Ne 8:5–6).

>  … to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever! Amen (Ro 16:27).

### Liturgical Greeting

“By this greeting and the people’s response, the mystery of the Church gathered together is made manifest.”[^2]

#### "The Lord be with you."

> The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you (2 Ti 4:22).

> I am with you always, to the end of the age (Mt 28:20).

#### "And with your spirit."

> May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers and sisters (Ga 6:18).

### Penitential Act

#### "Brethren, let us acknowledge our sins, and so prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred mysteries."

> Indeed, I was born guilty, a sinner when my mother conceived me (Ps 51:5).

#### "I confess to almighty God and to you …"

> Therefore confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed (Jas 5:16).

#### "Lord, have mercy."

> … a Canaanite woman from that region came out and started shouting, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is tormented by a demon” (Mt 15:22).

### Glory

“The Gloria in excelsis (Glory to God in the highest) is a most ancient and venerable hymn by which the Church, gathered in the Holy Spirit, glorifies and entreats God the Father and the Lamb.”[^3]

#### "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to people of good will."

> Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace among those whom he favors! (Lk 2:14).

#### "We praise you, we bless you, we adore you, we glorify you …"

> Let them praise the name of the LORD, for his name alone is exalted; his glory is above earth and heaven (Ps 148:13).

#### "Lord Jesus Christ, Only Begotten Son …"

> … we have seen his glory, the glory as of a father’s only son, full of grace and truth (Jn 1:14).

#### "Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father, you take away the sins of the world …"

> Here is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! (Jn 1:29).

## Liturgy of the Word

> Then [Moses] took the book of the covenant, and read it in the hearing of the people (Ex 24:7).

### Dialogues

#### "The Word of the Lord."

> “… the word of the Lord endures forever.” That word is the good news that was announced to you (1 Pe 1:25).

#### "Thanks be to God."

> Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift! (2 Co 9:15).

> Now to God who is able to strengthen you according to my gospel and the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery that was kept secret for long ages (Ro 16:25).

### "Alleluia"

'Alleluia' is a transliteration of two Hebrew words meaning “Praise the Lord!” 

> Praise the LORD! Praise the LORD, O my soul! (Ps 146:1; cf. Ps 146-150).

> After this I heard what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, “Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power to our God …” (Re 19:1).

### Creed: “I believe”

“The purpose of the Creed or Profession of Faith is that the whole gathered people may respond to the Word of God proclaimed in the readings taken from Sacred Scripture and explained in the Homily and that they may also honor and confess the great mysteries of the faith by pronouncing the rule of faith in a formula approved for liturgical use and before the celebration of these mysteries in the Eucharist begins.”[^4]

> Immediately the father of the child cried out, “I believe; help my unbelief!” (Mk 9:24).

> [Martha] said to him, “Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, the one coming into the world” (Jn 11:27).

### The Prayer of the Faithful

“In the Universal Prayer or Prayer of the Faithful, the people respond in some sense to the Word of God which they have received in faith and, exercising the office of their baptismal Priesthood, offer prayers to God for the salvation of all.”[^5]

#### "We pray to the Lord."

> <sup>22</sup> Repent therefore of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you. <sup>23</sup> For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and the chains of wickedness.” <sup>24</sup> Simon answered, “Pray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what you have said may happen to me” (Ac 8:22–24).

#### "Lord, hear our prayer."

> <sup>2</sup> Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD: <sup>3</sup> “Remember now, O LORD, I implore you, how I have walked before you in faithfulness with a whole heart, and have done what is good in your sight.” Hezekiah wept bitterly. <sup>4</sup> Before Isaiah had gone out of the middle court, the word of the LORD came to him: <sup>5</sup> “Turn back, and say to Hezekiah prince of my people, Thus says the LORD, the God of your ancestor David: I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; indeed, I will heal you; on the third day you shall go up to the house of the LORD (2 Ki 20:2–5).
