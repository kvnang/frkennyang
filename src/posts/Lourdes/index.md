excerpt: Lourdes is a town in France that attracts over 6 million visitors per year, with over 80,000 sick pilgrims visiting to seek healing. Lourdes is known for the apparitions of Mary to 14-year-old Bernadette Soubirous in 1858. Mary appeared to Bernadette 18 times between February 11 and July 16, 1858, at Massabielle Grotto. Mary's message was summarized in three words: prayer, penance, and conversion. Three gestures are performed by pilgrims at Lourdes: touching the rock, drinking and washing in the spring, and lighting a candle. These actions are identical to the ones Bernadette performed during the apparitions.

## Apparitions

Date: February 11–July 16, 1858

Mary appeared at **Massabielle Grotto** 18 times between February 11 and July 16, 1858, to 14-year-old [Bernadette Soubirous](/post/bernadette/). On February 11, Bernadette was gathering firewood along the bank of the River Gave when Mary appeared to her as a beautiful young girl of around 17 years old. Bernadette described Mary as

> dressed in a white robe, girded at the waist with a blue ribbon. She wore upon her head a white veil which gave just a glimpse of hair. Her feet were bare but covered by the last folds of her robe and a yellow rose was upon each of them. She held on her right arm a rosary of white beads with a chain of gold shining like the two roses on her feet.

## Historical Background

The [French Revolution](https://www.britannica.com/event/French-Revolution) (1789–1799) rejected Christendom and established a constitutional church. Catholic priests were invited to pledge allegiance to the State. Those who did not do so were persecuted alongside Catholics in general.

Following the French Revolution, a series of apparitions of Our Lady took place in France. She appeared 

- in Paris to St. Catherine Labourè (1830), after which she became known as [Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal](https://www.chapellenotredamedelamedaillemiraculeuse.com/langues/english/the-chapel-of-our-lady-of-the-miraculous-medal/);
- in La Salette (1846); and
- in Lourdes (1858).

You may ask: why France? Russian theology teaches that

> when the world would fight against the Savior, he would send ̉his Mother to save us.

When people rejected Christ, God sent his Mother. This might be an explanation of why Mary repeatedly came to France in the wake of the French Revolution.

## Message of Lourdes

We can summarize the message of Lourdes in three words: **prayer, penance, and conversion**. In her 8th apparition, Mary said:

> Penance! Penance! Penance! Pray to God for sinners. Kiss the ground as an act of penance for sinners!

Penance and Prayer. Penance means conversion—a turning toward God and toward our brothers and sisters.

## Gestures of Pilgrims

What should we do at Lourdes? Pilgrims here perform three gestures:

1. [touching the rock](),
2. [drinking and washing in the spring](), and
3. [lighting a candle]().

These actions are identical to the ones Bernadette performed during the apparitions.

### Touch the Rock

Gestures:
- Maintain silence
- Upon entering the Grotto, make the sign of the Cross.
- Contemplate the spring
- Touch or kiss the rock
- Say your prayer intention to Our Lady
- When leaving the Grotto, bow in silence before the statue of Our Lady.

Prayer for pilgrims:

> O Mary, Our Lady of Lourdes, you here, present in this Grotto and you hear the prayers of all your children. Some you comfort, others you help discover their vocation by giving them the strength to say ‘yes.’ Today, like Bernadette, I too am entering this holy place following this great crowd of people from every nation and every language. As the Mother of Jesus and Mother of the Church, you see each one as a unique individual. Cast your gaze upon me and let the light of your Son dwell in and soothe my heart.
> 
> Hail Mary …
> Our Lady of Lourdes, pray for us!
> Saint Bernadette, pray for us!”

Mary appeared to [Bernadette](/post/bernadette/) 18 times between February 18 and July 16, 1858, in this Grotto. During Bernadette's time, the Grotto was dirty, hidden, and cold. Pigs used to seek refuge there. Our Lady's white attire, symbolizing her purity, stood out in this obscurity.

During the 3rd apparition, the Lady invited Bernadette:

> Will you do me the honour of coming here for 15 days?

In the 13th apparition, Mary requested a **chapel to be constructed** on the rock (where the Basilica of the Immaculate Conception stands today):

> Go and tell the priests that people are to come here in procession and to build a chapel here.

Last, in the 16th apparition, Mary revealed her name:

> I am the Immaculate Conception.

Four years earlier, in 1854, Pope Pius IX declared the [Immaculate Conception a dogma](https://www.catholic.com/tract/immaculate-conception-and-assumption). Since news did not travel fast, at the time of the apparition in 1858, the dogma of the Immaculate Conception was known mainly to theologians and ecclesiastics. **Bernadette could not have made it up**. If she knew it as Mary’s name, **somebody must have told her: Our Lady herself**.

As we pass inside the Grotto where Our Lady appeared, we notice that the rock is smooth, polished by the loving caress of billions of pilgrims.

The rock has a strong biblical resonance. It is a metaphor for God:

> The Lord is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer, my God, my rock in whom I take refuge (Psalm 18:2).

Jesus also built his Church on Peter, the rock:

> And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church (Matthew 16:18).

### Drink and Wash

Gestures:
- Recite the Creed
- Drink from the palm of your hand
- Puts water on your face

---

On February 25, 1858, in the ninth apparition, 300 people were present. Mary told Bernadette:

> Go to the spring, drink and wash yourself there.

Bernadette said:

> I found only a little muddy water. On the fourth try I was able to drink. She also made me eat some of the herbs that were near the spring, then the vision disappeared, and I left.

The crowd asked Bernadette:

> Do you realise that doing these things makes us think that you are mad?

Bernadette replied:

> It’s for sinners.

The water from the spring at the base of the Grotto has led to healings and still flows today. It healed Bernadette from a serious chest inflammation on April 28, 1858.

The water that flows from Massabielle Grotto is not holy water, but rather ordinary water. It represents faith and baptism. People who have been healed by drinking or applying the water were not cured because of its special properties, but because they had faith.

### Light a Candle

Gestures:
- Light and place a candle in the Chapels of Light

Prayer for pilgrims:

> Jesus, “Light from light, true God from true God." Bernadette told us: “I saw a small young lady enveloped in light who looked at me and smiled”. This light of your Immaculate Mother is the reflection of your Light, You the conqueror of evil, sin and death! You, the Risen Christ! Today I place my candle in this burner. Today or later it will burn in your presence. May it illuminate my joy, my gratitude, my thanksgiving, your forgiveness and your immense mercy. May it clear my doubts, extinguish my pain, my hurt, my suffering, my lost cause! It also symbolises my most secret thoughts, wishes and desires. May the storms of life not extinguish the flame of love! May I become like Him burning with love for You and for my brothers and sisters! You, who live and reign for ever and ever. Amen.
>
> Hail Mary …
> Our Lady of Lourdes, pray for us!
> Saint Bernadette, pray for us!”

Every pilgrim in Lourdes carries a candle in the procession. Near the Grotto, over 700 tons of candles burn each year for you and those who cannot come. There are several reasons why people bring and light candles at Lourdes.

1. From the fourth apparition onwards, on arriving at the grotto, **Bernadette would light a candle and hold it** in her left hand for as long as Our Lady was visible to her.
2. Candles remind us of our **baptism**, through which we became children of God. A candle lit by the priest on the day of our baptism also symbolizes our duty to be "the light of the world" (Matthew 5:14).
3. Candles represents the **light of faith** guiding us until the day of the resurrection.
4. We light candles so that **our prayers can continue** even after we leave the Sanctuary.
