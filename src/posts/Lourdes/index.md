Mary appeared at **Massabielle Grotto** 18 times between February 11 and July 16, 1858, to 14-year-old [Bernadette Soubirous](/post/bernadette/). On February 11, Bernadette was gathering firewood along the bank of the River Gave when Mary appeared to her as a beautiful young girl of around 17 years old. Bernadette described Mary as

> dressed in a white robe, girded at the waist with a blue ribbon. She wore upon her head a white veil which gave just a glimpse of hair. Her feet were bare but covered by the last folds of her robe and a yellow rose was upon each of them. She held on her right arm a rosary of white beads with a chain of gold shining like the two roses on her feet.

## Historical Background

The [French Revolution](https://www.britannica.com/event/French-Revolution) (1789–1799) rejected Christendom and established a constitutional church. Catholic priests were invited to pledge allegiance to the State. Those who did not do so were persecuted alongside Catholics in general.

Following the French Revolution, a series of apparitions of Our Lady took place in France. She appeared 

- in Paris to St. Catherine Labourè (1830), after which she became known as [Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal](https://www.chapellenotredamedelamedaillemiraculeuse.com/langues/english/the-chapel-of-our-lady-of-the-miraculous-medal/);
- in La Salette (1846); and
- in Lourdes (1858).

You may ask: why France? Russian theology teaches that

> when the world would fight against the Savior, he would send ̉his Mother to save us.

When people rejected Christ, God sent his Mother. This might be an explanation of why Mary repeatedly came to France in the wake of the French Revolution.

## Message of Lourdes

We can summarize the message of Lourdes in three words: **prayer, penance, and conversion**. In her 8th apparition, Mary said:

> Penance! Penance! Penance! Pray to God for sinners. Kiss the ground as an act of penance for sinners!

Penance and Prayer. Penance means conversion—a turning toward God and toward our brothers and sisters.
