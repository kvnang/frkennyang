## About This Website

After over a year on several social media platforms, Fr. Kenny realized that they could only do so much. Before long, he yearned for a home on the internet where he could express his thoughts more thoroughly in order to better proclaim Christ to his contemporaries.

This is the exact purpose of this personal website. It was elegantly created in 2021 by Kevin Ang, who had developed websites and brandings for scores of institutions within the Catholic Church and beyond.
