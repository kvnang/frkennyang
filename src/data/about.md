# About Fr. Kenny

Fr. Kenny Ang, [S.T.B.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Sacred_Theology), [B.Phil.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Philosophy), is a Catholic priest. Raised in Jakarta, he has lived in Indonesia, the United States, Spain, and Italy. He first sensed his priestly vocation as he was mesmerized by the beauty of Catholic faith expressed in the [*Catechism of the Catholic Church*](https://www.usccb.org/sites/default/files/flipbooks/catechism/).

Since his diaconal ordination in 2018, he has been [invited to speak](https://www.fatherkenny.com/invite/) to groups and institutions in Indonesia, Singapore, and the United States. By helping you know and love your faith more deeply, he dreams of bringing you closer to Godâ€”your ultimate source of happiness.

A polyglot, an [organist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hygsiL9X_BY), and an avid photographer, Fr. Kenny is currently based in Rome, where he works on a thesis on St. Thomas Aquinas' doctrine of creation.

## About This Website

After over a year on several social media platforms, Fr. Kenny realized that they could only do so much. Before long, he longed for a home on the internet where he could express his thoughts more thoroughly in order to better proclaim Christ to his contemporaries.

This is the exact purpose of this personal website. It has been elegantly created in 2021 by Kevin Ang who, on his own and together with [Longbeard](https://www.longbeard.com/work/), had developed websites and brandings for scores of institutions within the Catholic Church and beyond.
